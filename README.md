# netflix-recommendation-system
A Python code created that allows users to key in their cast members and genre preferences. 
Dataset used in this project was extracted from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows.
Opened with netflix_titles.csv, so the movie/tv shows are limited to those only.
